    "- 이번 장은 앞서 00장에서 간략하게 설명하였던 합성곱 신경망을 활용하여 텍스트 분류 문제를 풀어보고자 한다. 합성곱 신경망은 주로 이미지에서 특징을 추출하여 이미지 판단을 하는 역할로 큰 성능을 이루었는데, 텍스트에서도 좋은 효과를 낼 수 있다는 점을 Yoon Kim (2014) 박사가 \"Convolution Neural Network for Sentence Classificaion\" (http://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014181.pdf) 활용하여 입증하였다.\n",

    "- RNN이 단어의 입력의 순서를 중요하게 반영한다면, CNN은 문장의 지역 정보를 보존하면서 각 문장 성분의 등장 정보들을 학습에 반영하는 구조로 풀어가고 있습니다. 학습을 하면서 각 필터 사이즈를 조절하면서 언어의 특징 값을 추출하게 되는데, 기존의 N-gram (2 그램, 3 그램) 방식과 유사하다고 볼 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 예를 들어 \"나는 배가 고프다\" 라는 문장을 2그램을 사용한다면, \"나 는 / 는 배 / 배 가 / 가 고프 / 고프 다/\" 로 각각 문장의 단어 성분을 쪼개어 활용 하는 접근방법을, 단어를 각 백터값을 투영하여 컨볼루션 필터값에 적용하는 원리입니다."
